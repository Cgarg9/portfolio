          Hey there! I'm <b>Chirag Garg</b>, a <b>final-year Computer Science student</b> at 
          <b> Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh</b>. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Chandigarh,

          Beyond coding, Iâ€™m an avid <b>binge-watcher</b> who loves <b>anime</b>, fast drives, and 
          engaging in <b>sports</b>. Whether it's building AI-driven solutions or exploring new tech stacks,
